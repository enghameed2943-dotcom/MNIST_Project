\# 🧠 MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition (PyTorch + Streamlit)



\## 📌 Project Overview



This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset.



The system includes:



\- End-to-end training pipeline

\- Model evaluation (confusion matrix + error analysis)

\- Visualization of misclassified samples

\- Web deployment with Streamlit

\- Real-time digit prediction (Upload + Drawing Canvas)
